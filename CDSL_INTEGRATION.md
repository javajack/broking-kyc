## 6. DDPI - Demat Debit and Pledge Instruction

### 6.1 Overview

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **SEBI Circular** | SEBI/HO/MIRSD/DoP/P/CIR/2022/153 dated October 6, 2022 |
| **Effective Date** | November 19, 2022 |
| **Replaces** | Power of Attorney (POA) |
| **Nature** | One-time authorization given by BO to DP/broker |
| **Scope** | Debit securities for settlement, pledge for margin, mutual fund transactions on exchange platforms, tendering in open offers |

### 6.2 DDPI vs POA

| Aspect | DDPI (New) | POA (Old - Discontinued) |
|--------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Scope | Limited to specific purposes only | Broad authority |
| Purposes | Settlement delivery, margin pledge, MF on exchange, open offer tendering | General demat operations |
| Risk | Lower - limited scope | Higher - broad authority |
| Online Submission | Yes (Aadhaar eSign) | Generally offline |
| Activation Time | ~24 working hours (online) | 2-5 business days |
| Revocation | Anytime by BO | Anytime by BO |

### 6.3 DDPI Authorization Flow

```
Step 1: BO initiates DDPI request via broker portal/app
   ↓
Step 2: DP generates DDPI form with pre-filled details
   ↓
Step 3: BO reviews and signs via:
   Option A: Aadhaar eSign (online - 24h activation)
   Option B: Physical form submission (offline - 2-3 days)
   ↓
Step 4: DP uploads signed DDPI to CDSL via BO Modify API / CDAS
   ↓
Step 5: CDSL activates DDPI flag on BO account
   ↓
Status: DDPI Active → No TPIN/OTP needed for routine trades
```

### 6.4 With vs Without DDPI

| Scenario | With DDPI | Without DDPI |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Selling Shares** | Automatic debit by broker | TPIN + OTP required each time (eDIS) |
| **Margin Pledge** | Broker can initiate pledge | BO must approve each pledge via TPIN/OTP |
| **Convenience** | High - seamless trading | Lower - manual auth each trade |
| **Security** | Moderate - limited scope auth | Higher - per-transaction authorization |
| **Cost** | Rs. 100 + 18% GST | No charge |

### 6.5 DDPI Communique Reference

- CDSL Communique: DP-332 (DDPI implementation)
- File format changes: DP-5565 (BO Setup/Modify changes for DDPI/POA holder fields)

| **Delivery** | SMS to registered mobile |
| **Activation** | 6 minutes after generation |
