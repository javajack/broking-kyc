<Diagram src="/diagrams/04-status-lifecycle.svg" label="12-State Application Lifecycle — Registration to Trading" />

Every state an application can be in — from the first mobile OTP to trading-ready. Tracks the user journey (9 screens), maker-checker review, and batch registration across agencies.

## Application Status Flow

```
REGISTERED → PAN_ENTERED → DIGILOCKER_PENDING → FILLING → GATE_CHECK → e_SIGNED → UNDER_REVIEW → APPROVED → REGISTERING → ACTIVE
```

**Terminal/blocked states:** GATE_FAILED (any blocking check fails), REJECTED (admin rejection)

## Status Transitions

| PAN_ENTERED | DIGILOCKER_PENDING | Redirected to DigiLocker (Screen 3) |
| DIGILOCKER_PENDING | FILLING | DigiLocker consent complete, data harvested |
| DIGILOCKER_PENDING | PAN_ENTERED | DigiLocker cancelled (retry) |
| FILLING | GATE_CHECK | Screen 8 declarations submitted |
| GATE_CHECK | e_SIGNED | Gate passed + e-Sign complete (Screen 9) |
| GATE_CHECK | GATE_FAILED | Any blocking check failed |
| GATE_FAILED | FILLING | User corrects issue + retries |
| e_SIGNED | UNDER_REVIEW | Auto — enters maker-checker queue |
| UNDER_REVIEW | APPROVED | Checker approval (after maker review) |
| UNDER_REVIEW | REJECTED | Checker rejection |
| REJECTED | FILLING | User resubmits with corrections |

## Blocking Gate Checks (Screen 8)

The gate evaluates these checks before allowing e-Sign:

| Check | Required Status | Source |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| PAN verification | Status = E (valid) | Decentro |
| PAN-Aadhaar linkage | Linked | Decentro |
| AML/PEP screening | Completed (any result) | TrackWizz |
| Bank verification | Penny drop complete | Decentro |
| DigiLocker consent | Data harvested | DigiLocker |

If any check hasn't completed (timeout/error), it blocks with a specific message telling the user what needs resolution.
