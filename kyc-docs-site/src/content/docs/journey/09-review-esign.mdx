<ScreenCard number={9} title="Review + Face Match + e-Sign (Final)" time="~60 seconds">

**Purpose:** Final review, biometric verification, and legally binding e-Sign. User is done after this screen.

## 3-Step Process

<StatusFlow nodes={["Review Application", "Selfie Face Match", "Aadhaar OTP e-Sign"]} />

### Step 1: Review Application
Scroll-through review of the complete pre-filled application. All data from Screens 1-8 is presented in a read-only summary. User confirms everything is correct.

### Step 2: Face Match
Selfie capture compared against the Aadhaar photo from DigiLocker.

| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|------------|
| Match threshold | >= 80% similarity |
| Liveness check | Must pass (anti-spoof) |
| Photo quality | Minimum 800px width |

### Step 3: Aadhaar OTP e-Sign
Digital signature on the complete application PDF.

| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Auth mode | Aadhaar OTP |
| Hash | SHA-256 |
| Certificate | CCA-compliant DSC |
| Output | Signed PDF with embedded certificate |

<Aside type="tip" title="IPV/VIPV: EXEMPTED">
Aadhaar eKYC (DigiLocker) was used on Screen 3. No video call needed per SEBI circular.
</Aside>

**USER DONE. Total journey: ~6 minutes.**

## Vendor Comparison: e-Sign

<VendorTable title="e-Sign">

| Vendor | Auth Modes | Key Features | Cost/sign |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Digio** <VendorBadge type="recommended" /> | Aadhaar OTP, Biometric, Face | CADES-compliant DSC. White-label SDK. KRA + DigiLocker + VIPV in one platform. 2-day integration. | Rs.15-25 |
| Setu <VendorBadge type="new" /> | Aadhaar OTP | Up to 25 signers. eStamp on-the-fly. Name match for Aadhaar eSign. Webhook notifications. | Contact |
| Leegality <VendorBadge type="new" /> | Aadhaar OTP | Zero license fee, pay-per-use. 55M+ eSigns. eStamping support. Less than 2-day integration. | ~Rs.25 |

<Aside type="note">
Leegality offers zero license fee and ~Rs.25/sign with eStamping — ideal for cost-sensitive or pilot deployments. Digio remains recommended because its multi-product stack (KRA + DigiLocker + VIPV + eSign) reduces overall vendor count and integration overhead.

## Vendor Comparison: Video KYC / VIPV (Fallback)

<VendorTable title="Video KYC / VIPV (for nomination opt-out / DigiLocker fallback)">

| Vendor | Compliance | Speed | Cost/call |
|--------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **HyperVerge** <VendorBadge type="recommended" /> | SEBI VIPV + RBI V-CIP | Less than 1 min (self-guided). 99.5% accuracy. 7-year recording storage. | Rs.30-50 |
| Digio <VendorBadge type="alternate" /> | SEBI VIPV + RBI V-CIP + IRDAI | 3-5 min. DigiStudio no-code workflow. Auto-reconnect. | Rs.30-50 |
| Signzy <VendorBadge type="new" /> | SEBI + RBI | 3-5 min. Works at 75 kbps bandwidth (best for Tier 3/4 coverage). 500K+ calls/month. | Contact |

</VendorTable>

<Aside type="caution">
VIPV is only needed in two scenarios: (1) the user opted out of nominations on Screen 7 and needs a video declaration, or (2) DigiLocker was unavailable and manual Aadhaar verification was used, which does not qualify for the IPV exemption.
</Aside>
