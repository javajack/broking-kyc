This is the finish line. The customer has passed the blocking gate, and all their data is verified and ready. Now they need to do three final things: review the complete application, take a selfie for face matching against their Aadhaar photo, and sign the application digitally using an Aadhaar OTP (One-Time Password). When this screen is complete, the customer is done. They close the app and wait for their account to be activated -- typically within 24-72 hours. Everything that follows (maker-checker review, KRA submission, exchange registration, depository account opening) happens entirely in the background.

<ScreenCard number={9} title="Review + Face Match + e-Sign (Final)">

**Purpose:** Final review, biometric verification, and legally binding eSign (electronic signature via Aadhaar OTP). User is done after this screen.

This screen has three distinct steps, presented sequentially. The customer cannot skip any of them. Each step serves a specific regulatory purpose.

## 3-Step Process

<StatusFlow nodes={["Review Application", "Selfie Face Match", "Aadhaar OTP e-Sign"]} />

### Step 1: Review Application
Scroll-through review of the complete pre-filled application. All data from Screens 1-8 is presented in a read-only summary. User confirms everything is correct.

:::note[Why a full review is required]
The review step is not just good UX -- it is a regulatory requirement. The customer must see and confirm all the data that will be submitted to KRA (KYC Registration Agency), CKYC (Central KYC), and the exchanges before they sign. This is the "informed consent" step. If a customer later claims they did not agree to certain information in their application, the signed PDF with the review confirmation is the audit trail.

### Step 2: Face Match
Selfie capture compared against the Aadhaar photo from DigiLocker (Government of India's digital document platform) using a biometric face matching service.

| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|------------|
| Match threshold | High confidence match required |
| Liveness check | Must pass (anti-spoof) |
| Photo quality | Minimum resolution per service requirements |

:::tip[Liveness detection is non-negotiable]
The face match step includes a liveness check to prevent spoofing -- someone holding up a printed photo or a screen showing someone else's face. The biometric verification service must meet ISO 30107 standards and detect prints, screens, videos, 3D masks, and deepfakes. Never implement face match without liveness detection.
:::

### Step 3: Aadhaar OTP e-Sign
Digital signature on the complete application PDF per IT Act 2000, Section 3A. This is the legally binding moment -- the customer's Aadhaar-authenticated signature is embedded in the PDF along with a CCA-compliant (Controller of Certifying Authorities) digital certificate.

| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Auth mode | Aadhaar OTP |
| Hash | SHA-256 |
| Certificate | CCA-compliant DSC |
| Output | Signed PDF with embedded certificate |

<Aside type="tip" title="IPV/VIPV: EXEMPTED">
Aadhaar eKYC (DigiLocker) was used on Screen 3. No video call needed per SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/DOP/CIR/P/2020/73.
</Aside>

## VIPV Fallback Scenarios

VIPV (Video In-Person Verification) is normally not needed in this flow because DigiLocker provides the IPV (In-Person Verification) exemption. However, there are two scenarios where it becomes necessary:

1. The user opted out of nominations on Screen 7 and needs a video declaration
2. DigiLocker was unavailable and manual Aadhaar verification was used, which does not qualify for the IPV exemption

In these cases, a SEBI VIPV-compliant and RBI V-CIP-compliant video verification must be conducted. The video recording must be stored for the period mandated by SEBI regulations.

## OCR Fallback

In rare cases where the DigiLocker flow was not used (e.g., DigiLocker downtime), document OCR (Optical Character Recognition) becomes necessary as a fallback for identity verification. The OCR service must support PAN, Aadhaar, Passport, Voter ID, Driving Licence, and cheque documents with tampering detection capabilities.

For vendor implementation options for eSign, face match, VIPV, and OCR, see [Vendor Integrations](/broking-kyc/vendors/).

The customer's part of the journey is complete. But the system's work is just beginning. What follows is the maker-checker review and the parallel batch pipelines that register the customer with every exchange and depository.

## What Happens Next?

:::note[User Is Done -- Backend Takes Over]
After e-Sign, the application enters **maker-checker review**. Once the checker approves, parallel batch pipelines fire:
KRA (2-3 days), CKYC (4-5 days), NSE/BSE/MCX (same day), CDSL (1-2 hrs), NSDL (~15 days), Income (1-2 hrs if F&O).
