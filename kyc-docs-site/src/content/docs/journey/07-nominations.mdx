**Purpose:** Capture nominee details or record opt-out declaration.

## Option A: Add Nominee(s)

| Field | Validation | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Name | Required | Full name of nominee |
| Relationship | Required | Select from dropdown |
| Date of Birth | Required | Valid date |
| Allocation % | Required | Percentage share |

Up to 10 nominees allowed (SEBI Jan 2025 regulation). Total allocation must equal 100%.

<Aside type="note">
Nominee details can be pre-filled from KRA/CKYC records if the user has existing nominee data on file. This reduces typing for users who are migrating from another broker.
</Aside>

## Option B: Opt Out of Nomination

The user selects "I choose to opt out of nomination." This requires an asynchronous video declaration to be completed within 30 days.

<Aside type="caution" title="Video Declaration Required">
Opting out of nomination requires a video declaration per SEBI rules. This is recorded asynchronously — the user does not need to complete it during onboarding, but must do so within 30 days. See [Video KYC / VIPV vendors](/journey/09-review-esign/) for vendor options.

## Timing

| Scenario | Time |
|----------|------|
| Single nominee | ~30 seconds |
| Multiple nominees | ~2 minutes |
| Opt-out (checkbox only, video deferred) | ~10 seconds |

## Regulatory Context

- **SEBI Jan 2025:** Maximum nominees increased from 3 to 10
- **Allocation:** Must total exactly 100% across all nominees
- **Minor nominees:** Guardian details required if nominee is a minor
- **Opt-out video:** Must be completed within 30 days of account opening; trading can proceed in the interim
