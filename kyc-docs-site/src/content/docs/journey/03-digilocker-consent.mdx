The customer has entered their PAN (Permanent Account Number) and DOB (Date of Birth), and tapped submit. Now the app redirects them to DigiLocker (Government of India's digital document platform) -- a government portal where they will authenticate with their Aadhaar number and a fresh OTP (One-Time Password). From the customer's perspective, they are simply granting consent to share their documents. From the system's perspective, this is the single most productive step in the entire journey: zero fields typed by the customer, yet a comprehensive set of identity fields harvested in one shot. Meanwhile, the four API calls fired on Screen 2 are completing in the background.

<ScreenCard number={3} title="DigiLocker Consent (Redirect)">

**Purpose:** Consent-based fetch of Aadhaar XML + PAN document. DigiLocker-based Aadhaar eKYC provides IPV exemption per SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/DOP/CIR/P/2020/73.

This is the only screen where the customer leaves the application. They are redirected to the DigiLocker portal, where they enter their Aadhaar number and verify with an OTP sent to their Aadhaar-linked mobile. Once they grant consent, DigiLocker returns them to the application with a rich payload of identity data.

## User Input

**0 fields** -- the user enters their Aadhaar number + OTP on the DigiLocker portal (not our app). A fresh Aadhaar OTP is sent here.

:::tip[Zero-effort data harvest]
This screen requires zero typing within the application. The customer authenticates directly with the government's DigiLocker portal. Yet it yields more data than any other screen in the journey -- pre-verified fields that would otherwise require manual entry and separate document uploads.
:::

The table below shows exactly what comes back from DigiLocker. Every one of these fields arrives pre-verified by the government, which means separate verification is not required.

## Data Harvested from DigiLocker

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Name (first / middle / last / full) | Aadhaar XML |
| Date of Birth | Aadhaar XML |
| Gender | Aadhaar XML |
| Photo | Aadhaar XML |
| Father's Name | Aadhaar XML |
| Full Address (8 fields) | Aadhaar XML |
| POI auto-set (Aadhaar) | Derived |
| POA auto-set (Aadhaar) | Derived |

<Aside type="tip" title="IPV Exemption">
Aadhaar eKYC via DigiLocker provides IPV (In-Person Verification) / VIPV (Video In-Person Verification) exemption per SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/DOP/CIR/P/2020/73. This eliminates the need for a separate video call step from the onboarding flow.
</Aside>

## Timing and Async Convergence

The DigiLocker redirect (consent + authentication + return) provides a natural window during which all 4 async API calls from [Screen 2](/broking-kyc/journey/02-pan-dob/) complete. By the time the user returns from DigiLocker, PAN verification, KRA (KYC Registration Agency) lookup, CKYC (Central KYC) search, and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) screening results are all available for pre-fill and gate evaluation on subsequent screens.

For vendor implementation options for DigiLocker integration, see [Vendor Integrations](/broking-kyc/vendors/).

<Aside type="caution">
If DigiLocker is unavailable, the fallback path requires Aadhaar OCR + manual document upload. This loses the IPV exemption and requires a VIPV (Video In-Person Verification) step per SEBI norms.
</Aside>

:::caution[OTP timeout during DigiLocker]
The DigiLocker session has a limited timeout window. If the customer takes too long to enter their Aadhaar OTP on the DigiLocker portal, the session expires and they are returned to the application without any data. The system must detect this gracefully and offer a retry. Do not assume every DigiLocker redirect will succeed on the first attempt.
