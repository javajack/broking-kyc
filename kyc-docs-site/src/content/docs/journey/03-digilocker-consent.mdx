<ScreenCard number={3} title="DigiLocker Consent (Redirect)" time="~60 seconds">

**Purpose:** Consent-based fetch of Aadhaar XML + PAN document.

## User Input

**0 fields** — the user enters their Aadhaar number + OTP on the DigiLocker portal (not our app). A fresh Aadhaar OTP is sent here.

## Data Harvested (~25 fields with zero effort)

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Name (first / middle / last / full) | Aadhaar XML |
| Date of Birth | Aadhaar XML |
| Gender | Aadhaar XML |
| Photo | Aadhaar XML |
| Father's Name | Aadhaar XML |
| Full Address (8 fields) | Aadhaar XML |
| POI auto-set (Aadhaar) | Derived |
| POA auto-set (Aadhaar) | Derived |

<Aside type="tip" title="IPV Exemption">
Aadhaar eKYC via DigiLocker = IPV/VIPV exempted per SEBI circular. This saves an entire video call step from the onboarding flow.
</Aside>

## Timing is Deliberate

This 60-second buffer (redirect + consent + return) is exactly the time needed for all 4 async API calls from [Screen 2](/journey/02-pan-dob/) to complete. By the time the user returns from DigiLocker, PAN verification, KRA lookup, CKYC search, and AML screening results are all available.

## Vendor Comparison: Aadhaar / DigiLocker

<Aside type="caution">
If DigiLocker is down, fallback to HyperVerge Aadhaar OCR + manual document upload. This loses the IPV exemption and requires a VIPV (Video In-Person Verification) step.
