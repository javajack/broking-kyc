**Purpose:** Select trading segments and provide income proof if required for derivatives.

## Segment Toggles

| Segment | Default | Income Proof Required |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| Equity / Cash | ON | No |
| F&O | OFF | Yes |
| Currency Derivatives | OFF | No |
| Commodity | OFF | Yes |

## Conditional Fields

If F&O or Commodity is selected, income proof upload becomes mandatory.

<Aside type="caution" title="SEBI Requirement">
F&O/Commodity segments require income verification. Bank statement must show credit of at least Rs.10,000 in last 6 months. Annual income threshold is broker-specific (typically Rs.1-10 lakh).

<Aside type="tip">
SEBI circular Aug 2022 allowed depositories (CDSL/NSDL) as FIPs in the AA ecosystem. Brokers can fetch demat holdings, bank statements, and ITR data via consent-based AA flow instead of manual document upload. See [Account Aggregator](/vendors/account-aggregator) for details.
