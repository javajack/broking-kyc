<ScreenCard number={1} title="Mobile / Email Registration" time="~30 seconds">

**Purpose:** Establish the identity anchor and OTP communication channel before any KYC data is captured.

## User Input

| Field | Validation | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Mobile Number (10 digits) | 10 digits starting with 6-9 | OTP sent via SMS for verification |

**Fallback:** Email registration if mobile OTP fails 3 times.

<AsyncBar>
On registration, device fingerprinting fires: **Bureau.id Device Intelligence** — 200+ risk signals, emulator/root detection, synthetic identity check.
</AsyncBar>

<Aside type="tip" title="Why start with mobile?">
Mobile number is the universal communication channel for OTPs, KRA verification, CKYC, and all post-onboarding notifications. Establishing it first ensures every subsequent step has a verified contact channel.
</Aside>

## What Fires Async

| Service | Vendor | What It Does |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Device Fingerprint | Bureau.id | 200+ risk signals per device. Detects emulators, rooted devices, synthetic identities, coordinated fraud rings. 99.7% persistence — survives factory resets. |

This device intelligence layer runs silently in the background. No user interaction required. Results feed into the AML/fraud evaluation at the [Blocking Gate (Screen 8)](/broking-kyc/journey/08-declarations-gate/).

## Data Captured

After this screen, the system has:
- Verified mobile number (OTP-confirmed)
- Device fingerprint and risk score
- Session identifier for all subsequent API calls
