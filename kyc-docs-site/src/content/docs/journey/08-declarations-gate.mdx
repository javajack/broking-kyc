<GateBox title="BLOCKING GATE — All must pass before e-Sign">

- **PAN Valid** — Status = E (exists and valid)
- **PAN-Aadhaar Linked** — Seeding status = Y
- **AML/PEP Clean** — Risk level = LOW or MEDIUM
- **Penny Drop Success** — Name match >= 70%
- **PMLA Checks** — Anti-money laundering compliance verified

</GateBox>

<Aside type="danger" title="Gate Failure">
If any gate check fails, the user cannot proceed to e-Sign. The system displays specific failure reasons and next steps:

- **PAN invalid/inactive:** Direct user to NSDL for PAN correction
- **PAN-Aadhaar not linked:** Direct user to Income Tax portal to link
- **AML/PEP high risk:** Route to manual compliance review
- **Penny drop failed:** Offer retry or alternate bank account
- **PMLA check failed:** Route to compliance officer for review
</Aside>

## Gate Check Sources

| Check | Fired At | Vendor | Result Ready By |
|-------|---------|--------|----------------|
| PAN Valid | Screen 2 | Decentro | Screen 4 |
| PAN-Aadhaar Linked | Screen 2 | Decentro (PAN verify) | Screen 4 |
| AML/PEP Clean | Screen 2 | TrackWizz | Screen 4 |
| Penny Drop Success | Screen 5 | Decentro | Screen 6 |
| PMLA Checks | Screen 2 | TrackWizz | Screen 4 |

<Aside type="tip">
All gate checks were fired asynchronously on earlier screens. By Screen 8, every result is already available. The gate is an evaluation step, not a waiting step — the user experiences zero additional latency here.
