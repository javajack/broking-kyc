The customer has just verified their mobile number. Now they see a screen with two fields: PAN (Permanent Account Number) and Date of Birth (DOB). To the customer, this feels like a simple identity check. Behind the scenes, this is the most consequential screen in the entire journey. The moment the customer taps "Submit," the system fires four parallel API calls that will determine whether this person can trade, what data is already on file for them, and whether they appear on any watchlists. Everything that follows -- pre-filled forms, compliance gates, the final approval -- traces back to what happens here.

<ScreenCard number={2} title="PAN + Date of Birth">

**Purpose:** Capture the two identity keys that unlock all downstream data lookups.

PAN is the universal financial identifier in India. Combined with DOB, it is the composite key that the KRA (KYC Registration Agency), CKYC (Central KYC) registry, and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) screening systems use to locate a person's records.

## User Input

| Field | Validation | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| PAN | `[A-Z]{5}[0-9]{4}[A-Z]`, 4th char P = Individual | Alphanumeric, 10 characters |
| Date of Birth | Valid date, age 18+ | Calendar picker |

<AsyncBar>
On submit, 4 parallel API calls fire (results ready by Screen 4):
**PAN Verify** | **KRA Lookup** | **CKYC Search** | **AML/PEP Screen**
</AsyncBar>

<Aside type="note">
These 4 async calls complete during the DigiLocker redirect on Screen 3. By the time the user reaches Screen 4 (Confirm Identity), all results are available for pre-fill and gate evaluation.
</Aside>

The system does not wait for any of these calls to return before moving the customer to Screen 3. All four run in parallel, and the DigiLocker (Government of India's digital document platform) redirect on the next screen provides a natural time buffer for them to complete.

## Async Operations Detail

| # | API Call | What It Returns | Used At |
|---|---------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | PAN Verify (NSDL/Protean) | Status (E/F/X/D/N), name, DOB match, PAN-Aadhaar link status | Gate (Screen 8) |
| 2 | KRA Lookup | KYC status, occupation, income range, net worth, existing KYC data | Pre-fill (Screen 4) |
| 3 | CKYC Search (CERSAI) | Masked CKYC number (since Jan 2025), identity data, address | Pre-fill (Screen 4) |
| 4 | AML/PEP Screen | Risk level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH), watchlist matches per SEBI AML/CFT guidelines | Gate (Screen 8) |

:::tip[Understanding PAN status codes]
The PAN verification response includes a status code that is critical for the blocking gate. **E** means the PAN exists and is active -- this is what you want. **F** means a fake or invalid PAN. **X** means deactivated. **D** means the PAN holder is deceased. **N** means not found. Any status other than **E** is a hard block at Screen 8.

## Verification Details

PAN verification is performed against NSDL/Protean databases. KRA lookup checks existing KYC records across all five KRAs (CVL, NDML, DOTEX, CAMS, KFintech) via interoperability. CKYC search queries CERSAI. AML/PEP screening runs per SEBI AML/CFT guidelines (SEBI/HO/MIRSD/DOP/CIR/P/2023/37).

For vendor implementation options, see [Vendor Integrations](/broking-kyc/vendors/).

:::caution[KRA lookup can return stale data]
KRA records are only as current as the last intermediary that updated them. If a customer opened an account with another broker two years ago and their address has changed since, the KRA data will still show the old address. Always treat DigiLocker data as the authoritative source for identity fields, and use KRA/CKYC data for pre-fill and cross-verification only.
