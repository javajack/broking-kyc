description: Reading path for the finance head or CFO of a broker — capital framework, settlement, brokerage economics, funds upstreaming, investor protection mechanisms, MTF interest, tax framework.

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You hold the capital that keeps the broker functioning, you sign off on the daily client-funds upstreaming, you watch the net-worth threshold like an instrument panel, and once a year you defend the audited financials to the statutory auditor. Operationally, you're the firewall between the broker's commercial operations and the regulator's view of the broker as a financially sound intermediary.

This page is your shortcut.

## What you'll find useful here

Three layers matter most:

- **Member Compliance deep-dives** — BMC / ABC, networth, fit-and-proper. Your continuing-compliance domain.
- **Settlement deep-dives** — direct-payout, upstreaming, payin default, MTF operational, Core SGF. The capital-side of operations.
- **Foundational deep-dives** — SGF, IPF, member default recovery. The capital-protection framework.

The reporting layer (compliance blueprint reporting domain) sits at the boundary of your function and the compliance officer's.

## Suggested reading path (in this order)

1. **[BMC / ABC deep-dive](/broking-kyc/deep-dives/member-compliance/bmc-abc/)** — the three-layer capital model (networth + BMC + ABC). The canonical reference for your firm's capital posture.

2. **[Client Funds Upstreaming deep-dive](/broking-kyc/deep-dives/settlement/client-funds-upstreaming/)** — the June 2023 SEBI mandate. Daily upstreaming flow, MFOS / FDR / cash collateral, bank-cutoff timing.

3. **[Direct Payout to Demat deep-dive](/broking-kyc/deep-dives/settlement/direct-payout-to-demat/)** — TM CUSPA / CM CUSPA / TM CSMFA. The chart-of-accounts restructure your team owns.

4. **[Payin Default + Core SGF deep-dive](/broking-kyc/deep-dives/settlement/payin-default-core-sgf/)** — the failure-mode scenario. Asset liquidation sequence; default-fund cascade.

5. **[SGF / Core SGF deep-dive](/broking-kyc/deep-dives/foundational/sgf-core-sgf/)** + **[Member Default Recovery deep-dive](/broking-kyc/deep-dives/foundational/member-default-recovery/)** — the capital-protection framework you're contributing to and protected by.

6. **[MTF Operational deep-dive](/broking-kyc/deep-dives/settlement/mtf-operational/)** — funding model, interest rate computation, automated invocation, client liability. If your firm offers MTF, this is your team's product.

7. **[IPF deep-dive](/broking-kyc/deep-dives/foundational/ipf/)** — Investor Protection Fund — the client-side equivalent of SGF. Your firm contributes to this.

8. **[Compliance Blueprint — Reporting domain](/broking-kyc/operations/compliance-blueprint/#reporting-cadences-40-entries)** — the reporting calendar that touches your function (GST, TDS, STT, monthly client funding, networth maintenance check).

9. **[ECN & Investor Servicing deep-dive](/broking-kyc/deep-dives/member-compliance/ecn-investor-servicing/)** — the format your team's ledger system produces; brokerage / STT / GST / exchange charges / SEBI fee / stamp duty.

10. **[Membership Renewal deep-dive](/broking-kyc/deep-dives/member-compliance/membership-renewal/)** — annual renewal procedure with fees and attestations.

That's the foundation.

<Aside type="tip">
**The capital model is the most consequential thing your role owns at a regulatory level.** Networth (broker continuous), BMC (clearing-corp deposit), ABC (variable top-up) — they interact but live at different layers. Breaching any of them has different consequences. The BMC / ABC deep-dive resolves the most common confusion.

## Common questions in your role

- **What's our current networth threshold for our segment activations?** → [BMC / ABC deep-dive](/broking-kyc/deep-dives/member-compliance/bmc-abc/) — Rs.3 crore minimum for stockbroker; segment-specific higher.
- **MTF interest rate that the broker can charge?** → [MTF Operational deep-dive](/broking-kyc/deep-dives/settlement/mtf-operational/) — industry-typical 12-18% per annum; SEBI doesn't prescribe a cap directly.
- **Per-onboarding cost?** → [Cost Analysis](/broking-kyc/reference/cost-analysis/) — Rs.85-175 per client typical.
- **A payin failed — what's the broker's exposure?** → [Payin Default + Core SGF deep-dive](/broking-kyc/deep-dives/settlement/payin-default-core-sgf/) — broker's deposit liquidates first, then SGF cascade.
- **Quarterly running-account settlement: who manages the funds movement?** → [Client Funds Upstreaming deep-dive](/broking-kyc/deep-dives/settlement/client-funds-upstreaming/) + [Compliance Blueprint Client Funds domain](/broking-kyc/operations/compliance-blueprint/#client-funds-21-entries).
- **GST / TDS / STT monthly cycles — where are the timing references?** → [Compliance Blueprint Reporting](/broking-kyc/operations/compliance-blueprint/#reporting-cadences-40-entries).
- **The clearing corp issued a margin call on our ABC — what's the response window?** → [BMC / ABC deep-dive](/broking-kyc/deep-dives/member-compliance/bmc-abc/) — replenishment timeline.
- **A client filed an IPF claim — what's the process?** → [IPF deep-dive](/broking-kyc/deep-dives/foundational/ipf/).
- **Statutory audit asked for our ABC contribution history — where's it documented?** → [BMC / ABC deep-dive — practical notes](/broking-kyc/deep-dives/member-compliance/bmc-abc/) + clearing-corp circulars indexed in [Circulars — Clearing Corps](/broking-kyc/reference/circulars/clearing-corps/).
- **What's our annual exchange membership renewal cost?** → [Membership Renewal deep-dive](/broking-kyc/deep-dives/member-compliance/membership-renewal/) — fees by exchange; typically refreshed annually.

## What to skip (and why)

- **OMS / RMS deep-dives** — Head of OMS/RMS territory; you only need to know they exist.
- **Trading-day / surveillance deep-dives** — same.
- **Field Atlas destination pages other than back-office / RMS** — engineer territory.
- **Lifecycle walkthroughs** — Operations Lead territory.
- **`appendix/*`** — out of your scope unless you specifically own that segment (e.g., NRI tax treatment).

## When you'd hand off

- **"Is this a compliance violation or just a procedural issue?"** → [Compliance Officer reading path](/broking-kyc/personas/compliance-officer/).
- **"How do we operationally fix this client funds reconciliation break?"** → [Operations Lead](/broking-kyc/personas/operations-lead/) + [Backend Engineer](/broking-kyc/personas/backend-engineer/).
- **"Should we activate this new segment from a capital perspective?"** → [Product Manager](/broking-kyc/personas/product-manager/) and you co-decide.
- **"Tax / legal advisory question"** → external counsel; out of this site's scope.
