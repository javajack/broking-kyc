Welcome to the KYC (Know Your Customer) onboarding specification. If you are new to the firm, this is the single most important system you need to understand. Every customer who wants to buy their first share, place their first F&O order, or simply open a demat account must pass through this gateway. Think of it as the bridge that transforms a stranger on the internet into a verified, regulation-compliant client who is authorized to trade on Indian stock exchanges. By the time you finish reading these docs, you will understand exactly how that transformation happens -- from the moment a user enters their mobile number to the moment their signed application reaches NSE, BSE, CDSL, and NSDL.

## What Is This?

A complete technical specification for **stock broking KYC onboarding** -- covering the regulatory data collection workflow, identity verification via government sources, batch submissions to KRA/CKYC/exchanges/depositories, maker-checker admin workflow, and full SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) / KRA (KYC Registration Agency) / CKYC (Central KYC) regulatory compliance. Built for an Indian stock broking firm enabling individual customers to complete KYC onboarding and begin trading.

:::tip[Where to start]
If you are a new engineer, start with the [User Journey](/broking-kyc/journey/) section. Walk through all 9 screens in order. That will give you the clearest mental model of what the customer experiences and what the system does at each step. Come back here afterward to explore the architecture, vendor integrations, and operations sections.

## Who Is This For?

Whether you are building features, integrating vendors, or answering compliance queries, there is a reading path for you.

The diagram below shows the complete onboarding flow. Spend a minute studying it -- every box corresponds to a section in these docs.

## Onboarding Flow

<Diagram src="/diagrams/01-onboarding-flow.svg" label="Complete Onboarding Flow — 9 Screens + Maker-Checker + Batch Pipelines" />

Here are the key dimensions of the system, derived from SEBI regulatory requirements and the KRA/CKYC/exchange/depository submission mandates.

## At a Glance

	<Card title="Multi-Step Identity Verification" icon="rocket">
		Mobile OTP → PAN verification → Government identity source (DigiLocker/Aadhaar) → identity confirmation → bank verification → trading preferences → nominations → declarations → eSign.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Comprehensive KYC Data Capture" icon="document">
		Government identity sources (DigiLocker, KRA, CKYC) provide pre-verified identity and financial data, minimizing manual data entry errors per SEBI KYC norms.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Identity, KRA, Exchange & Depository Integrations" icon="puzzle">
		PAN verification (NSDL/Protean), KRA agencies, CKYC (CERSAI), DigiLocker, eSign, AML screening, biometric verification, exchanges (NSE/BSE/MCX), and depositories (CDSL/NSDL). See [Vendor Integrations](/broking-kyc/vendors/) for implementation options.

	<Card title="8 Regulatory Batch Pipelines" icon="list-format">
		KRA, CKYC, NSE, BSE, MCX, CDSL, NSDL, and Income pipelines run asynchronously after maker-checker approval per SEBI dual-control requirements.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

:::note[Why so many vendors?]
Indian securities regulation requires identity verification through multiple independent sources -- PAN through NSDL/Protean, KYC status through KRA agencies, central identity through CKYC (CERSAI), and document verification through DigiLocker. No single vendor covers all of these. The vendor strategy section explains how we stitch them together.
