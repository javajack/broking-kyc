The 11 architectural rules that shape every screen and API call — read this first to understand why the system works the way it does. Every design decision flows from these principles.

## The 11 Principles

| # | Principle | Implementation |
|---|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | **Mobile-first registration** | Start with mobile OTP verification before any KYC data. Establishes the identity anchor and communication channel used for all subsequent OTPs, KRA verification, and post-onboarding notifications. |
| 2 | **DigiLocker-first** | Force Aadhaar + PAN fetch via DigiLocker consent. Harvests ~25 identity fields with zero typing. |
| 3 | **Aadhaar via DigiLocker** | DigiLocker consent flow provides Aadhaar eKYC without needing the user to type their Aadhaar number into our app. Strongest identity anchor with IPV exemption. |
| 4 | **Pre-fill everything** | DigiLocker + KRA + CKYC cover ~90 identity/financial fields. User only confirms. |
| 5 | **Async verification** | PAN verify, KRA lookup, CKYC search, AML screening fire in parallel while user is on DigiLocker. |
| 6 | **Minimal user typing** | ~12 fields: mobile, PAN, DOB, email, bank a/c, IFSC, a/c type + toggles. |
| 7 | **e-Sign everything** | Single Aadhaar OTP e-Sign on the complete application. No physical signatures. |
| 8 | **Batch submission** | KRA, CKYC, UCC, BO account submitted async after maker-checker approval. User never waits. |
| 9 | **IPV exemption** | Aadhaar eKYC (DigiLocker) exempts IPV/VIPV per SEBI circular. Saves one step. |
| 10 | **Progressive disclosure** | Only show fields relevant to choices (F&O income proof, FATCA, PEP). |
| 11 | **Fail fast, fail gracefully** | If blocking check fails, stop user before e-Sign. Don't waste their time. |

<Aside type="tip">
These principles directly map to the [9-screen user journey](/broking-kyc/journey/). Each screen is designed to collect the minimum input while maximizing pre-filled data from trusted sources.

## How Principles Connect

The principles work together as a system:

- **Principles 1-3** establish the identity foundation (mobile → PAN → DigiLocker)
- **Principles 4-6** minimize friction (pre-fill, async, minimal typing)
- **Principles 7-8** handle completion (e-Sign, batch)
- **Principles 9-11** optimize the experience (IPV exemption, progressive disclosure, fail fast)
