Visual architecture of the onboarding system — three SVG diagrams showing the complete 9-screen flow, data source mapping, and batch processing pipeline.

## Diagram 1: Complete Onboarding Flow

The full 9-screen user journey, maker-checker review, and batch agency pipelines.

<Diagram src="/diagrams/01-onboarding-flow.svg" label="Complete Onboarding Flow (9 Screens + Maker-Checker + Batch)" />

## Diagram 2: Data Source Mapping

Where each field comes from — resolution priority across DigiLocker, CKYC, KRA, vendor APIs, and user input.

## Diagram 3: Async Batch Processing Pipeline

The multi-agency batch pipeline that runs after maker-checker approval — KRA, CKYC, NSE, BSE, MCX, CDSL, NSDL pipelines in parallel.

## Diagram 4: Status Lifecycle

The 12-state application lifecycle — from REGISTERED to ACTIVE, with retry paths from GATE_FAILED and REJECTED.
