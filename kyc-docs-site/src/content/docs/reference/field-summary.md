title: Field Summary
description: All ~454 fields at a glance — grouped by section with field counts, data sources, and which screen captures each group.

This is the quick-reference companion to the [Master Dataset](/broking-kyc/reference/master-dataset). Where the master dataset gives you every field with data types, sizes, and validation rules, this page gives you the bird's-eye view -- how many fields per section, how many are mandatory, and where in the onboarding flow each group lives. You will find it useful when estimating scope for a new feature, answering "how many fields does the nominee section have?", or getting your bearings before diving into the full specification.

**Full field-level specification:** See [Master Dataset](/broking-kyc/reference/master-dataset) for complete field definitions with data types, sizes, validations, and regulatory sources.

## Section Overview

The KYC (Know Your Customer) system captures roughly 454 fields across 30 sections. Of those, about 200 are mandatory -- but the actual number a customer fills in manually is far smaller, since most fields are either prefilled from external systems or generated by the application itself.

:::tip[Reading the "Mandatory" column]
"system" means the fields are populated by API responses, not by the user. "conditional" means the fields become mandatory only for specific account types (minor, joint, NRI). Sections R through Z are largely system-generated -- you will not build UI forms for them, but you will query them in admin dashboards and reports.
