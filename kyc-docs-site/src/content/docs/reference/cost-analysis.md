What each onboarding costs in vendor API fees — per-transaction costs for every integration point, recommended vs cheapest alternate pricing, and a total cost-per-onboarding estimate.

| Bank Verify (Penny Drop) | Decentro | Rs.2-5 | Cashfree | Rs.2-4 |
| KRA Lookup/Submit | Digio | Rs.3-5 | CVL Direct | Rs.2-3 |

## Total Cost per Onboarding

| Scenario | Cost Range |
|----------|-----------|
| **Recommended stack** | **Rs.85-175** (with AA income verify for F&O) |
| **Cheapest stack** | **Rs.50-100** (equity-only, no F&O) |
| **Setu consolidation** | **Rs.70-130** (unified PAN+bank+eSign pricing) |

## Cost Optimization Strategies

- **Setu consolidation**: Unified pricing for PAN + bank + eSign can reduce per-unit costs
- **Leegality for eSign**: Zero license fee + pay-per-success model reduces eSign costs significantly
- **DigiLocker path**: Saves Rs.30-50/customer vs manual upload + VIPV (see [DigiLocker cost comparison](/vendors/identity/digilocker))
- **Account Aggregator**: Eliminates manual income proof upload for F&O activation
- **Volume negotiations**: Most vendors offer slab-based pricing at 10K+ onboardings/month
