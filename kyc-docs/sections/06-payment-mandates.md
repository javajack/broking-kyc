### UPI Block Mechanism (ASBA-like for Secondary Market)

::: {.info-box .red}
**Mandatory for QSBs from Feb 1, 2025.** SEBI mandated that Qualified Stock Brokers must offer either UPI block mechanism (funds blocked in customer bank, debited only on trade execution) OR 3-in-1 trading account. This is separate from autopay &mdash; it applies to trade settlement where customer funds stay in their bank until needed. Reduces counterparty risk.
